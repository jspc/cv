\section{About me}
A DevOps specialist working within Reliability Engineering, I have spent the majority of my career working across teams, geographically or by responsibility, solving scaling and performance in large scale production systems; largely split between Publishing and Finance, though with no small amount of ISP and Datacenter work. \\

I've a proven track record in the development of both internal tooling and external SDKs, with an emphasis on Developer Experience (DX) principles; specifically around open communication, facades over strict paradigms (for SDK development), and clear monitoring data emission.
