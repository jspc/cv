# cv

This project provides my CV; it uses no external classes/ typefaces which aren't generally distributed with latex distributions.

This project contains thre CVs, my CV for SRE work, my CV for DX work, and my CV for managerial work. Either CV can be built in the same way, with make:

```bash
$ make                               # builds all
$ make dist/jamescondron_dx_cv.pdf   # builds my DX cv
$ make dist/jamescondron_sre_cv.pdf  # builds my SRE cv
$ make dist/jamescondron_vpe_cv.pdf  # builds my managerial cv
```
