\section{About me}
A Software Engineering specialist working across a spectrum of companies, industries, and teams, I have predominantly spent my career building SaaS platforms, both internally and client facing, with a focus on Developer Experience principles. \\
\\
As an Engineering Manager I bring a wealth of experience in building and promoting a culture of engineering excellence through data-driven people management, actionable goal setting through meaningful 1-to-1s, and delivery and capacity management; all through the nurturing of talent through a DE\&I lens.\\
\\
I Specialise in:

\begin{itemize}
\item Building and scaling up teams
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Introducing data-driven, rubric based recruitment processes
  \item Building career ladders introducing clear, goal driven promotion paths
  \item Ensuring engineers have clear professional goals, increasing engagement and reducing attrition and turnover
  \item Continually assessing team culture, ensuring cultures grow, adapt, and reflect the values of the people within a team
  \end{itemize}
\item Hands-on technical leadership
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Leading and enabling architecture/ whiteboard sessions
  \item Incident management and troubleshooting, using skills gained from my time running NOCs in datacentres
  \item Using my years as an engineer to bring credibility as an Engineering Manager
  \end{itemize}
\item Agile methodologies, delivery management
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Over a decade working within Scrum
  \item Applying Kanban methodologies into Platform teams, which typically eschew such oversight
  \item Maintaining delivery and capacity plans
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
