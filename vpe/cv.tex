\section{About me}
A DevOps specialist working within startup environments, I have spent the majority of my career working across teams, geographically or by responsibility, solving the scaling and performance of both teams and systems in large scale production environments. While my career has been largely split between Publishing and Finance I have spent almost all of it in the startup world. \\
