\section{About me}
A Software Engineering specialist working within Platform and Data Platform Engineering, I have spent the majority of my career working across teams, geographically or by responsibility, solving scaling and performance in large scale production systems; largely split between Publishing and Finance, though with no small amount of ISP and Datacenter work. \\
\\
I have a proven track record in delivering scalable data platforms, built to ingest from many different sources, and designing and implementing fitting and modelling on top of this data. Recent projects include building tensorflow models which, given huge amounts of system and product data, predict failures on huge gaming sites.
\\
