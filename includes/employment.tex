  {Happening - an online gaming provider}
  {Engineering Manager}
  {\textit{Observability}: Inherited a team of three engineers working on Prometheus and Loki fed Grafana, all of whom had low morale, and felt dis-empowered from making long term decisions about their product. I introduced lightweight agile processes, epic leads, partnerships with other teams, and ran ideation sessions; all in order to give the engineers ownership of their own destiny. By the end of my time with this team, morale was markedly higher, engagement was up, delivery was more predictable, and our relationships with both stakeholders \textit{and} users were better.}

Built a product vision and strategy, including KPIs, walked the team through setting mission/vision (with 100\% buy-in), and set clear progression paths.

  {Design, ownership, and management of the award-winning Beamly Fragrance Finder platform, an AI driven chatbot which mapped user-profiles, personality questions, and decades worth of customer knowledge to purchasing recommendations; this team was massively behind-deadline and close to being over-budget when I was brought on to manage it. Through aggressive hiring, stakeholder management, and a general re-architecture of the platform, I brought it in on-time, under-budget, and was able to work alongside the sales team to restore trust to the product.
