  {Mint - Message Interface Format}
  {https://github.com/mint}
  {\texttt{mint} is a binary message format (similar to protobuf, thrift, etc.) designed to provide fast serialisation, a reasonably rich set of data types, and an easily extensible system of type validations. It exists to shift-left validations and transformations away from Data Warehouses and back to message producers, such as distributed systems producing \texttt{mint} messages into systems such as Kafka}
